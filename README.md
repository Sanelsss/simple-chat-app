This is An Application that uses API for communication between two clients/users. To use this app you need to sign up with your Gamail account. I provided this by using "firechat" API login. You can send and recieve messages, reset chat to zero chat value.I used core principles of object-oriented programming. I have used JavaScript and React concepts with CSS and HTML. For better functioning I used multiple React Hooks,classes, encapsulation and polymorphism. You can find this application deployed on Netlify: "https://firechat-5fa8c.web.app/" It's working for both mobile and web.
